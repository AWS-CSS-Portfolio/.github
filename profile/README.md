## Topics Covered

- **Domain 1: Incident Response** – Automating security responses; investigating and analyzing incidents & remediating compromised resources.
- **Domain 2: Logging and Monitoring** – Built centralized monitoring with CloudTrail, CloudWatch and Athena. Enabled real-time alerts (SNS) and threat-hunting queries.
- **Domain 3: Infrastructure Security** – Securing VPC, subnets and networking; Security group, NACL, firewall policies & Hybrid/cloud infrastructure security design.
- **Domain 4: Identity and Access Management** – Built a cross-account IAM model where Dev users securely assume a role in the Security Account with External ID protection. Enforced organization-wide guardrails using Service Control Policies (SCPs) to block destructive actions and validated with AWS CLI testing of both allowed and denied operations.
- **Domain 5: Data Protection** – Designed and validated encryption at rest & in transit using a KMS CMK, S3 default encryption + TLS-only policies and an RDS instance encrypted with the CMK. Verified compliance via CLI tests showing AccessDenied vs Success.
- **Domain 6: Management and Security Governance** - Organization-wide governance enforced with Service Control Policies (SCPs). Prevented risky actions like S3 bucket deletions and ensured compliance across Dev/Prod accounts.
